function [M,cluster_vec,trash_mass] = omt_clustering_w_entropy_reg_penalty_logstable_w_trashstate(C,trash_cost,epsilon,eta,R)
%
%
% Solve clustering problem where we do not specify number of targets but
% instead promote sparse solution. This problem includes a trash state.
% Note that the cost matrix C describes actual transport and the trash_cost
% (scalar) is given separately.
%
% Specifically, the problem solved is
%
% min_{M,m_trash} trace(C^T M) + eta*norm(M)_{\infty,1} + epsilon*D(M)
%               + c_trash*1_\Tau^T m_trash + epsilon*D(m_trash)
%
% subject to
%           M 1_\Omega + m_trash = 1_\Tau , M^T 1_\Tau <= R(R-1)/2 1_\Omega
%
% where \Omega is the set of candidate targets and \Tau is the set of
% TDoAs, with 1_\Omega and 1_\Tau being vectors all-ones with length equal
% to cardinalities of \Omega and \Tau, respectively.
%
% D(M) = \sum_{k,ell} m_{k,ell}log(m_{k,ell} - m_{k,ell}
% is the discrete entropy. This automatically gives non-negative solutions.
%
% The first constraint ensures that the elements are <= 1 in the optimal
% point. Together with D(M), this gives optimal M with elements in [0,1].
%
% The penalty norm(M)_{\infty,1} is the sum of the infinity norms of the
% columns of M, i.e., norm(M)_{\infty,1} = \sum_{ell} max(M(:,ell)). This
% promotes the clustering.
%
% For stability, the computations are carried out in log-domain.
%
%%%%% Additional routines needed %%%%%%
% min_logsumexp_l1_ball     -       sub-routine required for implementing
%                                   the sparsity penalty.
% stable_log_sum_exp        -       function for computing log-sum-exp in a
%                                   stable way. Required for log-stable
%                                   computations.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%%%%%%% Input %%%%%%%%%%%
% C             -       cost matrix, should have size |\Tau|\times|\Omega|.
%                       Note: this SHOULD NOT include the trash cost.
% trash_cost    -       scalar, cost for moving to trash state. Could be
%                       vector also.
% epsilon       -       strictly positive scalar. This is the entropy
%                       regularization parameter. The smaller this
%                       parameter, the closer to the original OMT problem.
%                       Smaller value will effect convergence speed, but
%                       should not affect numerical stability.
% eta           -       sparsity penalty parameter. The larger, the fewer
%                       columns of the optimal transport plans will be
%                       non-zero.
% R             -       number of receivers.
%
%%%%%%% Output %%%%%%%%%%
% M             -       transport plan, matrix of size
%                       |\Tau|\times|\Omega|. Indicates which TDoA is
%                       associated with which target. Elements of transport
%                       plan should be between zero and one in optimum.
% cluster_vec   -       vector of length |\Omega|. This is the summation of
%                       M along columns, saying how much TDoA "mass" is
%                       assigned to each candidate target. Each element
%                       is constrained to be bounded from above by R(R-1)/2
%                       as each target can be associated with at most that
%                       number of TDoAs. Note: cluster_vec = M^T 1_\Tau.
% trash_mass    -       vector of length |\Tau| containing the mass
%                       transported to the trash state.
